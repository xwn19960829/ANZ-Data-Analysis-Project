# ANZ-Data-Analysis-Project
This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions. The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data.

This project consists of the following docs:
- ANZ synthesised transaction dataset: the original data set from ANZ. All the sensitive data have been encrypted
- Wannie+ANZ+Data+Analysis.ipynb: Python code for this project
- Module 1 Analysis: Data Visualisation for this project (can be open from Tableau)
